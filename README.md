# Python_ChatGPT
The Python code you provided is a simple chatbot that uses the OpenAI API to generate responses to user input.

Lines 1-2: Import the OpenAI Python Library and the Config file. 
The Config file contains the OpenAI API key, which is needed to make requests to the OpenAI API.

Line 3: Set the OpenAI API key.

Lines 5-6: Print a greeting and instructions to the user.

Lines 8-9: Initialize the assistant context with a message from the system.

Lines 11-18: The main loop of the chatbot.

# Get the user input.
content = input("What do you want to talk about? ")

# If the user input is "Exit", break out of the loop.
if content == "Exit":
    break

# Add the user input to the assistant context.
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": content})

# Generate a response to the user input using the OpenAI API.
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages)

# Get the response content from the OpenAI API response.
response_content = response.choices[0].message.content

# Add the response content to the assistant context.
messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response_content})

# Print the response content to the user.
print(response_content)
The chatbot will continue to generate responses to user input until the user types "Exit".
